### My Little Story
On 14th November, 2019, my personal computer got infected by the 'best' (in the negative) virus I've ever heard of. Other infections I've heard of would limit things you can do in your system or wouldn't allow you turn it on but you could still gain access to your files.
This virus - DJVU Ransomware, encrypted almost all files in my system but surprisingly allowed me to use my system with installed applications.

It also left a _readme.txt file in several locations of my system which contained the requirement for recovering my files. The requirement was paying a ransom of $980 (or $490 if response was withini 72hrs) to get all my files decrypted. Where would I get such amount from?

This prompted my research and the following informations.

### DJVU Ransomeware: What it is, examples
DJVU ransomware is a virus which encrypts files stored in a user's computer with the use of certain ciphers. The virus usually leaves a note in several locations of the user's system which contains the requirements on recovering the encrypted files.

Examples include .grod, .peet, .toec, .nakw, derp, .coot.
I was affected with .grod. Hence, the solutions (which would be shared later in this article) would be more particular about .grod as there may be a little difference when compared to other types. Though, they are classified as DJVU viruses so solutions could still apply to others.
