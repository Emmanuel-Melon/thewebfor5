### My Little Story
On 14th November, 2019, my personal computer got infected by the 'best' (in the negative) virus I've ever heard of. Other infections I've heard of would limit things you can do in your system or wouldn't allow you turn it on but you could still gain access to your files.
This virus - DJVU Ransomware, encrypted almost all files in my system and also added a .grod extension to them but surprisingly allowed me to use my system with installed applications. At first, I removed the .grod extension hoping my files would restore but I discovered it was more than that.

It also left a _readme.txt file in several locations of my system which contained the requirement for recovering my files. The requirement was paying a ransom of $980 (or $490 if response was withini 72hrs) to get all my files decrypted. Where would I get such amount from?

This prompted my research and the following informations.

### DJVU Ransomeware
#### What it is,
DJVU ransomware is a virus which encrypts files stored in a user's computer with the use of certain ciphers. The virus usually leaves a note in several locations of the user's system which contains the requirements on recovering the encrypted files.

#### Examples
Examples include .grod, .peet, .toec, .nakw, derp, .coot.

#### How does it get into a system
It usually gains access through malicious mail attachments, application cracks, keygens and few other suspicious means.<br/>
**Confession:** I actually  tried downloading a cracked application which was my way of inviting the virus : (

### Dealing with .grod virus
I was affected with .grod. Hence, the solutions would be more particular about this as there may be little differences when compared with other types. Though, they are classified as DJVU viruses so solutions could still apply to others.

#### Removing the virus
I came across many solutions while going through websites and articles, some of which I applied.
Two major articles I read are:
- [How To Remove GROD Ransomware (Virus Removal Guide)](https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-grod-virus/)
- [Grod file extension. Remove Grod virus. Restore, Decrypt .grod files](https://www.myantispyware.com/2019/11/14/grod-file-extension-remove-grod-virus-restore-decrypt-grod-files/)
