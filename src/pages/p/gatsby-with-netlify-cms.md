In this article, I'd be explaining how to manage contents (which are published continuously) with Netlify CMS.

I'd assume that you have a Gatsby site already running. Also, I'd be more particular about blogs since they a better example for a regular publishing site. However, there are greater powers of Gatsby and Netlify CMS.

\### Introduction

\##### What is Netlify CMS
From [netlifycms.org/docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/)
> Netlify CMS is an open source content management system for your Git workflow that enables you to provide editors with a friendly UI and intuitive workflows. You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.
